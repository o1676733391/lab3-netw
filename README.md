└── README.md
```

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have Python installed. You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Server

To start the TCP server, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

```
python server/server.py
```

The server will start listening for incoming connections on the specified port.

## Connecting a Client

You can connect to the server using any TCP client. You can also implement a simple client using Python's socket library or use tools like `telnet` or `netcat`.

## Usage

Once connected, you can send messages to the server, and it will respond accordingly. The server can handle multiple clients concurrently.
